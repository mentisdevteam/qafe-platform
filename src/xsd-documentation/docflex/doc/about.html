  1.&nbsp; Overview
</h2>

<p>DocFlex/XML is the most advanced application of
<a href="http://www.filigris.com/products/docflex/about.php" target="_blank">DocFlex Technology</a>
(developed on top of the experience accumulated from the previous two:
<a href="http://www.filigris.com/products/docflex_javadoc/about.php" target="_blank">DocFlex/Javadoc</a> and
<a href="http://www.filigris.com/products/docflex_together/about.php" target="_blank">DocFlex/Together</a>).

<p>This tool allows you to visually design the automatic generation of professional quality reports
and documentation by the data obtained from your XML files. The output documents can be
generated in RTF and HTML  formats. The HTML can be both single-file and multi-framed documentation.
The TXT (plain text) output is supported as well, which enables you to use this tool also for various
XML file transformations.

<p>Such a generation is programmed using templates, which functionally behave very much the same
as full-blown scripting-language programs (such as
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt" target="_blank">XSLT</a> scripts). However, the advantage
of the template approach offered by
<a href="http://www.filigris.com/products/docflex/about.php" target="_blank">DocFlex Technology</a>
is that it requires very few coding of anything manually and allows to design your templates
in the WYSIWYG form in terms of things you expect to see in the output documents (rather than on the
level of abstract language operators).

<p>The templates are visually designed basing on the information obtained from
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/dtd/" target="_blank">DTD</a> or
<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/schema/" target="_blank">XSD</a> (W3C XML Schema)
files mostly by using mouse and specifying properties in Template Designer dialogs. The data type
information (i.e. XML elements and attributes) appears in various treeviews which are used
to program the data processing in the templates.

<p>The formatting of the generated documents is programmed by specifying formatting properties of
<a href="http://www.filigris.com/products/docflex/features/templates_designer.php#template_components" target="_blank">template components</a>
(some of which can be changed simply by dragging mouse in the designer pane).
Many of such properties are graphically visualized by the Template Designer.
<p>
The output generator can be both launched
<a href="doc.html#generator">from the command line</a> and invoked directly from the Template Designer's
main menu which allows you to immediately see the result produced by your templates
yet during designing them (no compilation or running any stand-alone interpreter are required).

     <li>rendering of embedded HTML, which means interpreting in non-HTML output formats (such as RTF)
         the HTML tags embedded in text data (e.g. documentation comments). Almost all HTML tags practically
         usable in doc-comments are supported.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

  <ul>
    <li>
      The possibility to call templates from one another.
    </li>
    <li>
      The elaborated support of template parameters.

      organize template libraries, which may help you to shorten the project
      development time and simplify its further updates and maintenance.
    </li>
    <li>
      The open Java API which allows to launch the DocFlex generator directly from your
      Java code, pass template parameters as well as to extend your templates with
      custom written Java classes. <i>(coming soon)</i>
    </li>
    <li>

  <a name="technical_requirements"></a>
  3.&nbsp; Technical Requirements
</h2>

<p>DocFlex/XML requires
Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> 2 version 6.x, 5.x or 1.4.x installed on your system.

<p>DocFlex/XML is a pure Java application.
The <a href="http://www.filigris.com/products/docflex_xml/doc.php#designer" target="_blank">Template Designer</a>
GUI is implemented entirely using Swing. Therefore, everything is supposed to work on any operating
system where Java2 Runtime Environment can be installed.

<p>Specifically, the DocFlex/XML software (both editions) available for
<a href="http://www.filigris.com/downloads/" target="_blank">downloads</a>
includes <b>MS Windows</b> BAT files and <b>Linux</b> shell script files that allow to run
DocFlex/XML on those operating systems immediately after installing it.
For more details, see product README files on downloads page.

<p>To parse XML files, DTDs and XML Schemas, DocFlex/XML uses
<a href="http://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/" target="_blank">Apache Xerces2 Java Parser</a> version 2.9.0,
whose binaries are included in the DocFlex/XML 
<a href="http://www.filigris.com/downloads/" target="_blank">downloads</a>.
In the case of any questions concerning this library, please refer to the Apache Xerces home page:
<a href="http://xerces.apache.org" target="_blank">http://xerces.apache.org</a>.

    <td><b>Note:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Certain heavy template applications (e.g. <a href="xsddoc/about.html">XSDDoc</a>,
        the XML schema documentation generator) may require considerable computational resources.
        To run them, you may need a powerful enough computer (e.g. with Intel Pentium 4 or
        AMD Athlon processor) and at least 512 MB RAM memory.

<h2>
  <a name="freeware_edition"></a>
  4.&nbsp; Freeware Edition
</h2>

<p>The freeware edition called <b>&ldquo;DocFlex/XML (Kit)&rdquo;</b>
includes only the template interpreter
(output <a href="doc.html#generator">generator</a>) without the Template Designer.
It is intended for the following purposes:
<ul>
  <li>
    As a freeware documentation generator for some standard XML applications
    (using included templates).
  </li>
  <li>
    As a <a href="doc.html#generator">command line</a> interpreter
    for your custom templates (however, only those created with the licensed full
    version).
  </li>
  <li>
    As a Java library, which will allow you to call processing of your templates directly
    from your Java code (<i>this possibility will be supported soon</i>).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, the freeware edition is supplied with the following sets of templates:
<ul>
  <li class="mrg8">
    <a href="xsddoc/about.html"><b>XSDDoc</b></a> (<b>&ldquo;XML Schema Documentation Generator&rdquo;</b>)
    set of templates implements a professional quality documentation generator for any W3C XML Schema
    able to produce both multi-framed Javadoc-like HTML and printable RTF documentation.
  </li>
  <li class="mrg8">
    <a href="xmldoc.html"><b>XMLDoc</b></a> (<b>&ldquo;XML File Documentor&rdquo;</b>)
    set of templates will allow you to compile any number
    of generic XML files into a nice looking web-ready HTML or printable
    RTF documentation with the optional inclusion of a namespace binding report.
  </li>
</ul>
